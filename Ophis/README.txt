This is the Windows standalone installation of the Ophis assembler.

Ophis is a command-line application, and as such, you will need to
edit your environment to put the Ophis install directory into your
path.

To do this on Windows XP:

1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Select "System".
3. Select the "Advanced" tab.
4. Click "Environment Variables".
5. Locate the "Path" variable in the "System Variables" tab.
6. Click "Edit".  A dialog box should appear.
7. Add a semicolon, and then the Ophis install directory to the end of this list.
8. Click "OK", closing the edit window.
9. Click "OK", closing the Environment Variables window.
10. Click "OK", closing the System Panel.

Now Ophis should be runnable from any command environment.
